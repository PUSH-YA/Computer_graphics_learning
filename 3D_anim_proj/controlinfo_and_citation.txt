Implemented features and keybindings:  
R to reverse the direction of seahorse travelling directions 
J to start the jump animation in the direction of th circle they were going in
The corals are pulsating to mimick the coral movement
The seahorse moves by bending its neck and tail while its dorsal fin flaps at a relatively faster relatively
The scene includes transluscent water, rocks / shells and arch in the back
Seafloor bed added to create ocean bed texture so computer does not have to process 100s of geometries being computationally efficient
