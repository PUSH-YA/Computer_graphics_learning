This repository encapsulates my journey of learning how to create video animations using threeJS and the GLSL pipeline. Use all the projects with the [js](https://github.com/PUSH-YA/Computer_graphics_learning/tree/main/js) folder given outide of the directory!

# 3D animation

My first project includes setting up 3D objects and creating animation using linear interpolation between different keyframes. I have also added a text file stating how to trigger certain animations such as jumping or reversing the direction of motion.

# Fragment shader

My second project includes building several different shaders using a "holey" shader, a cartoony shader (discretising the diffused light) and environment mapping to reflect the cube-mapped environment around it. I also included some moving holes in the environment mapping fragment shader to incorporate my learnings from the previous project. Procedural shader is also created using Perlin noise.

# Raytracing 

The last project includes an object lit up with a [Phong lighting model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model). Then different raytracing models are created with 2 bounces and 3 bounces which can be triggered by the corresponding numbers: "1", "2", and "3". Again motion is incorporated into this project along with procedural background to incorporate the learnings from the previous projects.
